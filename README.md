# nanoraytracer
Minimal GLSL ray tracing sphere reflection

Very base example on how to raytrace sphere. Based on extremely beautiful and simple 
shader and relative tutorial by kig. The purpose of this shader is not to be 
as small as possibile but to write clear code useful for understand the math behind-the-scene.
